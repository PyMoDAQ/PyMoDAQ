Data Management
===============
Data are at the center of the PyMoDAQ ecosystem. From their acquisition up to
their saving and plotting, you'll be confronted with them. It is therefore of
paramount importance that data objects be well understood and be used
transparently by all of PyMoDAQ's modules.

.. note::
  Moreover, a proper data management system and tools to manipulate and plot data
  could be very useful for offline data analysis. We invite the reader to look at the
  :ref:`data_analysis_tutorial` tutorial for use case examples.
