Instrument Plugins
==================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   :caption: Contents:

Any new hardware has to be included in PyMoDAQ within a :term:`plugin`. A PyMoDAQ's plugin is a python package
containing several added functionalities such as instruments objects. A instrument object is a class inheriting from either
a ``DAQ_Move_base`` or a ``DAQ_Viewer_base`` class and implementing mandatory methods for easy and quick inclusion of the instrument
within the PyMoDAQ control modules.

Plugins are articulated given their type: Moves or Viewers and for the latter their main dimensionality: **0D**, **1D** or **2D**.
It is recommended to start from the *template* `repository`__ that includes templates for all kind of instruments and also
the generic structure to build and publish a given plugin.

You will find below some information on the **how to** but comparison with existing plugins packages will be beneficial.

.. note::
   You'll find in this documentation a detailed tutorial on :ref:`plugin_development`.

Installation
------------

The main and official list of plugins is located in the `pymodaq_plugin_manager`__ repository on github. This constitutes a
list of (contributed) python package that can be installed using the :ref:`PluginManager<plugin_manager>` (or directly using pip).
Other unofficial plugins may also be installed if they follow PyMoDAQ's plugin specifications but you are invited
to let know other users of the plugins you develop in order to contribute to PyMoDAQ's development.

PyMoDAQ is looking at startup for all installed packages that it can consider as its plugins. This includes by default
the *pymodaq_plugins_mock* package of mock instruments installed on the *site_packages* location in your python distribution.

__ https://github.com/PyMoDAQ/pymodaq_plugin_manager

Contributions
-------------

If you wish to develop a plugin specific to a new hardware or feature not present on the github repo (and I strongly encourage you
to do so!!), you will have to follow the rules as below.

Two cases are possible: either you want to add a new hardware from a manufacturer for which
a repository already exists 1) (thorlabs, PI, Andor...) or not 2)

#. You have to fork the existing repo
#. you will use the `pymodaq_plugins_template`__  on github to create a new repo (see also the :ref:`new_plugin`
   tutorial)

Once you've done that, you can clone the package locally and install it in developer using ``pip install -e .`` from
the command line where you *cd* within the cloned package.
This command will install the package but any change you apply on the local folder will be applied on the package.
Then just add a new python file in the correct location.

Once you're ready with a working plugin, you can then:

#. Publish your repo on pypi (just by doing a release on github will trigger the creation
   of a pypi repository
#. do a pull request on the initial repository to merge your new implementations.

.. note::

  Starting with PyMoDAQ version 4.1.0 onwards, old github actions for publication and suite testing should be updated in
  the plugin packages. You can just use the one from the template repository

__ https://github.com/PyMoDAQ/pymodaq_plugins_template

All the packages published on pypi using the template and the naming convention will be available
in the plugin manager.

A very detailed tutorial has been published in this documentation: :ref:`plugin_development`
and you can in the mean time look at this `video`__

__ https://youtu.be/9O6pqz89UT8


Naming convention
-----------------

For an instrument plugin to be properly recognised by PyMoDAQ, the location and name of the underlying script must
follow some rules and syntax. The `plugin template package`__ could be copied locally as a starting point:

* The plugin package will be named pymodaq_plugins_xxxx (name: xxxx)
* An actuator plugin (name: xxxx) will be a script whose name is daq_move_Xxxx (notice first X letter is capital)
* The main instrument class within the script will be named DAQ_Move_Xxxx (notice the capital letters here as well and sorry
  if it is troublesome)

* A detector plugin of dimensionality N (N=0, 1, 2 or N) (name: xxxx) will be a script whose name is daq_NDviewer_Xxxx
  (notice first X letter is capital, and replace N by 0, 1, 2 or leave it for higher dimensionality)
* The main instrument class within the script will be named DAQ_NDViewer_Xxxx (notice the capital letters here as well)

.. _hardware_settings:


Value Reached?
--------------

Every time, you trigger an absolute or relative value change in your DAQ_Move, PyMoDAQ will wait before
sending a `move_done` signal. The value change is considered as done if the current value reached the
target value at a certain tolerance. This tolerance is a float number called epsilon within the code and in the UI.

Here is a snippet of this calculation:

.. code-block::

  if not abs(self._current_value - self._target_value) < self.epsilon:
      # keep trying to reach the value

.. note::

  From PyMoDAQ >= 4.4.0, this condition include working units, the code snippet looks like:

  .. code-block::

    if not (self._current_value - self._target_value).abs().value(self.axis_unit) < self.epsilon:
        # keep trying to reach the value


  where all quantities holds an information about their units, for instance `epsilon` could be expressed
  in *Âµm* (micron) (controller units) while _current_value (related to what is printed on the UI) could be expressed
  in *mm*. This feature is available naturally by using the PyMoDAQ DataManagement ecosystem with units compatibility.

Hardware Settings
-----------------

An important feature similar for all modules is the layout as a tree structure of all the hardware parameters.
These settings will appear on the UI as a tree of parameters with a title and different types, see :numref:`figure_settings`.
On the module side, they will be instantiated as a list of dictionaries and later exist in the object ``self.settings``.
This object inherits from the ``Parameter`` object defined in `pyqtgraph`__.


__ https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/parametertree/parameter.html

   .. _figure_settings:

.. figure:: /image/settings_example.PNG
   :alt: Settings example

   Typical hardware settings represented as a tree structure (here from the ``daq_2Dviewer_AndorCCD`` plugin)

Here is an example of such a list of dictionaries corresponding to :numref:`figure_settings`:

.. code-block:: python

   [{'title': 'Dll library:', 'name': 'andor_lib', 'type': 'browsepath', 'value': libpath},
    {'title': 'Camera Settings:', 'name': 'camera_settings', 'type': 'group', 'expanded': True, 'children': [
        {'title': 'Camera SN:', 'name': 'camera_serialnumber', 'type': 'int', 'value': 0, 'readonly': True},
        {'title': 'Camera Model:', 'name': 'camera_model', 'type': 'str', 'value': '', 'readonly': True},
        {'title': 'Readout Modes:', 'name': 'readout', 'type': 'list', 'values': ['FullVertBinning','Imaging'], 'value': 'FullVertBinning'},
        {'title': 'Readout Settings:', 'name': 'readout_settings', 'type': 'group', 'children':[
            {'title': 'single Track Settings:', 'name': 'st_settings', 'type': 'group', 'visible': False, 'children':[
                {'title': 'Center pixel:', 'name': 'st_center', 'type': 'int', 'value': 1 , 'default':1, 'min':1},
                {'title': 'Height:', 'name': 'st_height', 'type': 'int', 'value': 1 , 'default':1, 'min':1},
                ]},]}]}]


.. _parameter_tree:

The list of available types of parameters (defined in ``pymodaq.utils.parameter.pymodaq_ptypes.py``) is:

* ``group`` : "camera settings" on :numref:`figure_settings` is of type group
* ``int`` : settable integer (SpinBox_Custom object)
* ``float`` : settable float (SpinBox_Custom object)
* ``str`` : a QLineEdit object (see Qt5 documentation)
* ``list`` : "Readout Modes" :numref:`figure_settings` is a combo box
* ``bool`` : checkable boolean
* ``bool_push`` : a checkable boolean in the form of a QPushButton
* ``led`` : non checkable boolean in the form of a green (True) of red (False) led
* ``led_push`` : checkable boolean in the form of a green (True) of red (False) led
* ``date_time`` : a QDateTime object (see Qt5 documentation)
* ``date`` : a QDate object (see Qt5 documentation)
* ``time`` : a QTime object (see Qt5 documentation)
* ``slide`` : a combination of a slide and spinbox for floating point values (linear of log scale)
* ``itemselect`` : an object to easily select one or more items among a few
* ``browsepath``: a text area and a pushbutton to select a given path or file
* ``text`` : a text area (for comments for instance)

**Important**: the *name* key in the dictionaries must **not** contain any space, please use underscore if necessary!

.. note::

  For a live example of these Parameters and their widget, type in ``parameter_example`` in your shell or check the
  example folder


Once the module is initialized, any modification on the UI hardware settings will be send to the plugin through
the ``commit_settings`` method of the plugin class and illustrated below (still from the ``daq_2Dviewer_AndorCCD`` plugin).
The ``param`` method argument is of the type ``Parameter`` (from ``pyqtgraph``):

.. code-block:: python

    def commit_settings(self,param):
        """
            | Activate parameters changes on the hardware from parameter's name.
        """
        try:
            if param.name()=='set_point':
                self.controller.SetTemperature(param.value())

            elif param.name() == 'readout' or param.name() in custom_parameter_tree.iter_children(self.settings.child('camera_settings', 'readout_settings')):
                self.update_read_mode()

            elif param.name()=='exposure':
                self.controller.SetExposureTime(self.settings.child('camera_settings','exposure').value()/1000) #temp should be in s
                (err, timings) = self.controller.GetAcquisitionTimings()
                self.settings.child('camera_settings','exposure').setValue(timings['exposure']*1000)
            elif param.name() == 'grating':
                index_grating = self.grating_list.index(param.value())
                self.get_set_grating(index_grating)
                self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('show_splash', ["Setting wavelength"]))
                err = self.controller.SetWavelengthSR(0, self.settings.child('spectro_settings','spectro_wl').value())
                self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('close_splash'))



.. _data_emission:

Emission of data
----------------
When data are ready (see :ref:`data_ready` to know about that), the plugin has to notify the viewer module in order
to display data and eventually save them. For this PyMoDAQ use two types of signals (see pyqtsignal documentation
for details):

* ``dte_signal_temp``
* ``dte_signal``

where ``dte`` stands for DataToExport, see :ref:`datatoexport`.

.. note::
  So far (07/07/2023) instrument plugins would use signals below to emit a list of DataFromPlugins objects

  * ``data_grabed_signal_temp`` (old style, will be deprecated)
  * ``data_grabed_signal`` (old style, will be deprecated)

  It will be deprecated in versions > 4.1, as the object to use and emit are now DataToExport objects

They both *emit* the same type of signal but will trigger different behaviour from the viewer module. The first is to be
used to send temporary data to update the plotting but without triggering anything else (so that the DAQ_Scan still awaits
for data completion before moving on). It is also used in the initialisation of the plugin in order to preset the type
and number of data viewers displayed by the viewer module. The second signal is to be used once data are fully ready to
be send back to the user interface
and further processed by DAQ_Scan or DAQ_Viewer instances. The code below is an example of emission of data:

.. code-block:: python

    from pymodaq.utils.data import Axis, DataFromPlugins, DataToExport
    x_axis = Axis(label='Wavelength', units= "nm", data = vector_X)
    y_axis = Axis(data=vector_Y)
    self.dte_signal.emit(DataToExport('mydata', data=[
        DataFromPlugins(name='Camera',data=[data2D_0, data2D_1,...],
                        dim='Data2D', x_axis=x_axis,y_axis=y_axis),
        DataFromPlugins(name='Spectrum',data=[data1D_0, data1D_1,...],
                        dim='Data1D', x_axis=x_axis, labels=['label0', 'label1', ...]),
        DataFromPlugins(name='Current',data=[data0D_0, data0D_1,...],
                        dim='Data0D'),
        DataFromPlugins(name='Datacube',data=[dataND_0, dataND_1,...],
                        dim='DataND', nav_indexes=(0,2),
                        axes=[Axis(data=.., label='Xaxis', units= "Âµm", index=0)]))

Such an emitted signal would trigger the initialization of 4 data viewers in the viewer module. One for each
``DataFromPlugins`` in the data attribute (which is a list of DataFromPlugins). The type of data viewer will be
determined by the *dim* key value while its name will be set to the *name* parameter value, for more details on
data objects, see :ref:`data_objects`

.. note::
  *New in version 4.1.0*

  *Deprecated in version 4.2.0, but still working*

  The behaviour of the `DAQ_Viewer` can be even more tailored using two extra boolean attributes in the DataWithAxes objects.

  * ``save``: will tell the DAQ_Viewer whether it should save the corresponding dwa (short for ``DataWithAwes``)
  * ``plot``: will tell the DAQ_Viewer whether it should plot the corresponding dwa

  *New in version 4.2.0*

  the `save` and `plot` extra-attributes have been replaced by:

  * ``do_save``: will tell the DAQ_Viewer whether it should save the corresponding dwa (short for ``DataWithAwes``)
  * ``do_plot``: will tell the DAQ_Viewer whether it should plot the corresponding dwa

  ``DataFromPlugins`` objects have these two extra attributes by default with values set to True


.. _data_ready:

Data ready?
***********
One difficulty with these viewer plugins is to determine when data is ready to be read from the controller and then
to be send to the user interface for plotting and saving. There are a few solutions:

* **synchronous**: The simplest one. When the ``grab`` command has been send to the controller (let's say to its
  ``grab_sync`` method), the ``grab_sync`` method will hold and freeze the plugin until the data are ready.
  The Mock plugin work like this.

* **asynchronous**: There are 2 ways of doing asynchronous *waiting*. The first is to poll the controller state to check if data are
  ready within a loop. This polling could be done with a while loop but if nothing more is done then the plugin will still be
  freezed, except if one process periodically the Qt queue event using ``QtWidgets.QApplication.processEvents()`` method. The
  polling can also be done with a timer event, firing periodically a check of the data state (ready or not). Finally, the
  nicest/hardest solution is to use callbacks (if the controller provides one) and link it to a ``emit_data`` method.

Synchronous example:
********************

The code below illustrates the poll method using a loop:

.. code-block:: python

    def poll_data(self):
        """
        Poll the current data state
        """
        sleep_ms=50
        ind=0
        data_ready = False
        while not self.controller.is_ready():
            QThread.msleep(sleep_ms)

            ind+=1

            if ind*sleep_ms>=self.settings.child(('timeout')).value():

                self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('raise_timeout'))
                break

            QtWidgets.QApplication.processEvents()
        self.emit_data()


Asynchronous example:
*********************

The code below is derived from *daq_Andor_SDK2* (in *andor* hardware folder) and shows how to create a thread waiting for data ready and triggering the emission of data

.. code-block:: python

    class DAQ_AndorSDK2(DAQ_Viewer_base):

        callback_signal = QtCore.Signal() #used to talk with the callback object
        ...

        def ini_camera(self):
            ...
            callback = AndorCallback(self.controller.WaitForAcquisition) # the callback is linked to the controller WaitForAcquisition method
            self.callback_thread = QtCore.QThread() #creation of a Qt5 thread
            callback.moveToThread(self.callback_thread) #callback object will live within this thread
            callback.data_sig.connect(self.emit_data)  # when the wait for acquisition returns (with data taken), emit_data will be fired

            self.callback_signal.connect(callback.wait_for_acquisition) #
            self.callback_thread.callback = callback
            self.callback_thread.start()

        def grab(self,Naverage=1,**kwargs):
            ...
            self.callback_signal.emit()  #trigger the wait_for_acquisition method

    def emit_data(self):
        """
            Function used to emit data obtained by callback.
        """
        ...
        self.dte_signal.emit(
            DataToExport('mydata',
                         data=[DataFromPlugins('Camera',
                                               data=[np.squeeze(self.data.reshape((sizey, sizex)).astype(np.float))])])


    class AndorCallback(QtCore.QObject):

        data_sig=QtCore.Signal()
        def __init__(self,wait_fn):
            super(AndorCallback, self).__init__()
            self.wait_fn = wait_fn

        def wait_for_acquisition(self):
            err = self.wait_fn()

            if err != 'DRV_NO_NEW_DATA': #will be returned if the main thread called CancelWait
                self.data_sig.emit()

Documentation from Andor SDK concerning the WaitForAcquisition method of the dll:

..

  | *unsigned int WINAPI WaitForAcquisition(void)*
  |
  | ``WaitForAcquisition`` can be called after an acquisition is started using StartAcquisition to put the calling thread to sleep until an Acquisition Event occurs.
  | It will use less processor resources than continuously polling with the GetStatus function. If you wish to restart the calling thread without waiting for an Acquisition event, call the function CancelWait.


.. _hardware_averaging:

Hardware averaging
******************

By default, if averaging of data is needed the Viewer module will take care of it software wise. However, if the hardware
controller provides an efficient method to do it (that will save time) then you should set the class field
``hardware_averaging`` to ``True``.

.. code-block:: python

    class DAQ_NDViewer_Template(DAQ_Viewer_base):
    """
     Template to be used in order to write your own viewer modules
    """
        hardware_averaging = True #will use the accumulate acquisition mode if averaging
        #is True else averaging is done software wise


Live Mode
*********

By default, the live *Grab* mode is done software wise in the core code of the DAQ_Viewer. However, if
one want to send data as fast as possible, the live mode is possible within a plugin.

For this, the plugin class attribute, ``live_mode_available``, should be set to ``True``.

.. code-block:: python

    class DAQ_2DViewer_MockCamera(DAQ_Viewer_base):

        live_mode_available = True

The method ``grab_data`` will then receive a named boolean parameter (in ``kwargs``) called *live* that tells if one should
grab or snap data. The MockCamera plugin illustrates this feature:

.. code-block:: python

    def grab_data(self, Naverage=1, **kwargs):
        """Start a grab from the detector

        Parameters
        ----------
        Naverage: int
            Number of hardware averaging (if hardware averaging is possible, self.hardware_averaging should be set to
            True in class preamble and you should code this implementation)
        kwargs: dict
            others optionals arguments
        """
        if 'live' in kwargs:
            if kwargs['live']:
                self.live = True
                # self.live = False  # don't want to use that for the moment

        if self.live:
            while self.live:
                data = self.average_data(Naverage)
                QThread.msleep(kwargs.get('wait_time', 100))
                self.dte_signal.emit(data)
                QtWidgets.QApplication.processEvents()



Hardware needed files
---------------------

If you are using/referring to custom python wrappers/dlls... within your plugin and need a place where to copy them
in PyMoDAQ, then use the ``\hardware`` folder of your plugin package. For instance, the ``daq_2Dviewer_AndorCCD`` plugin need various files stored
in the ``andor`` folder (on github repository). I would therefore copy it as ``\pymodaq_plugins_andor\hardware\andor``
and call whatever module I need within (meaning there is a __init__.py file in the *andor* folder) as:

.. code-block:: python

    #import controller wrapper
    from pymodaq_plugins.hardware.andor import daq_AndorSDK2 #this import the module DAQ_AndorSDK2 containing classes, methods...
    #and then use it as you see fit in your module


Actuator plugin having multiple axis
------------------------------------
See also: :ref:`multiaxes_controller`

When an actuator's controller can drive multiple axis (like a XY translation stage for instance), the plugin instrument
class should defines two class attributes:

* `is_multiaxis` should be set to True. This will trigger the display of the multiaxis section on the UI\n
  Deprecated in 4.4.1 not needed anymore as one read that info from the length of the axis_names variable
* `axes_names` should be a list or dict describing the different actuator (axis) such a controller can drive

.. note::
    New in 4.4.1
    Moreover two other attributes should then be transformed as list or dict (depending the definition
    of the `_axis_names` variable, namely:

    * `_controller_units`: can be a list or a dict of strings specifying the units to be
      used by each axis. In case of a list or dict, the type and length should be the same as `axis_names`
      In case all axes have the same working *units*, could be left as a str. PyMoDAQ handles the rest
    * `_epsilon`: deprecated, please use `_epsilons`
    * `_epsilons`: can be a list or dict of float specifying the epsilon to be used by each axis.
      In case of a list or dict, the type and length should be the same as `axis_names`
      In case all axes have the same *epsilon*, could be left as a float. PyMoDAQ handles the rest


.. code-block::

    class DAQ_Move_MockNamedAxes(DAQ_Move_base):
        _axis_names = ['Xaxis', 'Yaxis', 'Zaxis']
        # or:
        _axis_names = {'Xaxis': 0, 'Yaxis': 1, 'Zaxis': 2}

would produce such display on the UI (Fig. :numref:`multiaxes_xyz`):


   .. _multiaxes_xyz:

.. figure:: /image/DAQ_Move/multiaxes_xyz.png
   :alt: Settings example

   Typical multiaxis settings represented as a combo box

Both the list or the dictionary will produce the same output on the UI but their use will depend of the controller and
underlying methods of its driver to act on a particular axis. In the drivers derived from C code,
methods will have an argument describing a particular axis as an integer. It is however not possible to pass
integers directly to the combobox of the UI who holds strings. To deal with that `pyqtgraph`, and therefore `pymodaq`,
uses a dictionary mapping the names of the axis (to be printed in the UI) to objects (here integers) to be
used with the drivers's method.

A set of methods/properties have been introduced to quickly manipulate those and get either the current
axis name of associated *value*.

Case of a list of strings:

.. code-block::

    >>> self.axis_name
    'Yaxis'
    >>> self.axis_names
    ['Xaxis', 'Yaxis', 'Zaxis']
    >>> self.axis_value
    'Yaxis'

Case of a dictionary of strings/integers:

.. code-block::

    >>> self.axis_name
    'Yaxis'
    >>> self.axis_names
    {'Xaxis': 0, 'Yaxis': 1, 'Zaxis': 2}
    >>> self.axis_value
    1

Other properties will then reflect the current axis units and epsilon value:

* `self.epsilon`
* `self.axis_unit`



Modifying the UI from the instrument plugin class
-------------------------------------------------

The user interface control module and the instrument plugin class are not in the same thread, moreover, the plugin
class is not aware of the UI object (``DAQ_Move`` or ``DAQ_Viewer``).
The following shows, how the instrument plugin class ``DAQ_Move_MyPluginClass`` relates to ``DAQ_Move``:

.. code-block:: python

   class DAQ_Move:
      def init_hardware(self...):
         hardware: DAQ_Move_Hardware
         hardware.moveToThread()

   class DAQ_Move_Hardware:
      hardware: DAQ_Move_Base

   class DAQ_Move_MyPluginClass(DAQ_Move_Base):
      """Plugin class defined in a plugins repository."""


Therefore, you'll find below ways to interact with the UI from the plugin class.

The most generic way (valid for both control modules) is to use the ``emit_status`` method, defined in the parent class
of the instrument plugin class.
Such a method takes one argument, a ``ThreadCommand`` and will send this object to the ``thread_status`` method of the UI main class.

.. note::
  A :py:class:`ThreadCommand<pymodaq.utils.daq_utils.ThreadCommand>` is an object taking two arguments a string (the command) and a named attribute called attribute
  that can be any type. This :py:class:`ThreadCommand<pymodaq.utils.daq_utils.ThreadCommand>` is used everywhere
  in PyMoDAQ to communicate between threads.

  New in 5.0.1: two extra arguments (args and kwargs) can be used to store arguments that should be passed to
  an eventual method triggered from the ThreadCommand emission (see the command *update_ui* for an example).


Control modules share some commands,
see :py:meth:`thread_status<pymodaq.control_modules.utils.ControlModule.thread_status>`

* **update_status**: call the update_status method with status attribute as a ``str``. To print info on the status bar
* **close**: close the current thread and delete corresponding attribute on cascade.
* **update_main_settings**: update the *main settings* in the UI settings tree. See below for an exemple.
  The attribute argument is a list containing:
  * the setting path as a tuple of strings (with the 'main_setting' parent setting)
  * the new value, limit or option of the setting
  * the type of change of the setting as a string, either:
    * 'value': to change the setting value
    * 'limits': to change the limits of the setting
    * 'options': any option of the setting
* **update_settings**: update the *actuator's settings* in the UI settings tree. The attribute argument is a list
  containing:
  * the setting path as a tuple of strings (with the 'main_setting' parent setting)
  * the new value, limit or option of the setting
  * the type of change of the setting as a string, either:
    * *value*: to change the setting value
    * *limits*: to change the limits of the setting
    * *options*: any option of the setting
* **raise_timeout**: call the raise_timeout method
* **show_splash**: show the splash screen displaying info. The attribute argument is a string that will
  be displayed on the splash screen
* **close_splash**: close the splash screen
* **update_ui**: call a method of the control module current UI. The attribute argument is a string beeing the
  name of the method to call. The args and kwargs arguments are passed to this method

Splash Screen and info
**********************

You can therefore show info about initialization in a splash screen using (taken from the Mock 0DViewer plugin):

.. code-block::

  self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('show_splash', 'Starting initialization'))
  QtCore.QThread.msleep(500)
  self.ini_detector_init(old_controller=controller,
                       new_controller='Mock controller')
  self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('show_splash', 'generating Mock Data'))
  QtCore.QThread.msleep(500)
  self.set_Mock_data()
  self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('update_main_settings', [['wait_time'],
                                 self.settings['wait_time'], 'value']))
  self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('show_splash', 'Displaying initial data'))
  QtCore.QThread.msleep(500)
  # initialize viewers with the future type of data
  self.dte_signal_temp.emit(DataToExport('Mock0D', data=[
      DataFromPlugins(name='Mock1', data=[np.array([0])],
                      dim='Data0D', labels=['Mock1', 'label2'])]))
  self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('close_splash'))

Modifying the UI settings
*************************

if you want to modify the settings tree of the UI (the *Main Settings* part or the hardware part, you can do so within the
plugin directly) using:

.. code-block::

  self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('update_main_settings', [['wait_time'], 10, 'value']))

or

.. code-block::

  self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('update_settings', [['wait_time'], 10, 'value']))

The attribute of the ThreadCommand is a bit complex here ``[['wait_time'], 10, 'value']``. It is a list of three
variables:

* a list of string defining a path in the main_settings tree hierarchy
* the new value, limit or option of the setting (here an integer)
* a string specifying the type of modification, either:

  * *value*: the object should therefore be the new value of the modified parameter
  * *limits*: the object should be a sequence listing the limits of the parameter (depends on the type of parameter)
  * *options*: the object is a dictionary defining the options to modify
  * *childAdded*: the object is a dictionary generated using SaveState of a given Parameter


DAQ_Move specific commands
**************************

Specifics commands for the :py:class:`DAQ_Move<pymodaq.control_modules.daq_move.DAQ_Move>` are listed in:
:py:meth:`thread_status<pymodaq.control_modules.daq_move.DAQ_Move.thread_status>` and explained a bit below

* **ini_stage**: obtains info from the initialization. The attribute argument should be a dict containing a *initialized* key and
  associated boolean value and an *info* key and associated string value
* **get_actuator_value**: update the UI current displayed value. The attribute argument is a DataActuator whose
  value and unit will be displayed on the UI.
* **move_done**: update the UI current value and emits the move_done signal
* **outofbounds**: emits the bounds_signal signal with a True argument
* **set_allowed_values**: used to change the behaviour of the spinbox controlling absolute values, see
  :py:meth:`set_abs_spinbox_properties<pymodaq.control_modules.daq_move_ui.DAQ_Move_UI.set_abs_spinbox_properties>`
* *stop*: stop the motion
* *units*: update the UI units. The attribute argument should be a string specifying the new unit.


You can directly modify the printed current actuator's value using the
``emit_value(DataActuator(data=12.4, units='m'))`` method which is a shortcut
of ``emit_status(ThreadCommand('get_actuator_value', DataActuator(data=12.4, units='m')))``.
In that case the printed value would show ``12.4 m``.

You can also modify some SpinBox of the UI (the ones used to specify the absolute values) using the *set_allowed_values*
command. In that case the attribute argument of the ThreadCommand should be a dictionary, see
:py:meth:`set_abs_spinbox_properties<pymodaq.control_modules.daq_move_ui.DAQ_Move_UI.set_abs_spinbox_properties>`.


DAQ_Viewer specific commands
****************************

Specifics commands for the :py:class:`DAQ_Viewer<pymodaq.control_modules.daq_viewer.DAQ_Viewer>` are listed in:
:py:meth:`thread_status<pymodaq.control_modules.daq_viewer.DAQ_Viewer.thread_status>` and explained a bit below


* ini_detector: update the status with "detector initialized" value and init state if attribute not null.
* grab : emit grab_status(True)
* grab_stopped: emit grab_status(False)
* init_lcd: display a LCD panel. the attribute argument should be a dictionnary  directly passed as named arguments
  to the LCD object
* lcd: display on the LCD panel. the attribute argument should be a list of numpy arrays of shape (1,)
* stop: stop the grab

The interesting bit is the possibility to display a
:py:class:`LCD widget<pymodaq.utils.gui_utils.widgets.lcd.LCD>` to display some numerical values (could be
0D Data also emitted using the ``dte_signal`` but could also be any values). You should first init the LCD screen
using the command: ``init_lcd`` with an attribute being a dictionary with keys either:

* digits: an integer specifying the number of digits to display
* Nvals: the number of numerical values to be displayed
* labels: the name/label of each value

For instance, in the 0D Mock viewer plugin:

.. code-block::

    if not self.lcd_init:
        self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('init_lcd', dict(labels=['dat0', 'data1'], Nvals=2, digits=6)))
        QtWidgets.QApplication.processEvents()
        self.lcd_init = True
    self.emit_status(ThreadCommand('lcd', data_tot))

Where the lcd is first initialized, then data are sent using the ``lcd`` command taking as attribute a list of 0D
numpy arrays
