* PyMoDAQ is used as the core acquisition program of several experiments at CEMES/CNRS and the main
  interface of its HC-IUMI Ultrafast Electron Microscope
* The attolab platform at CEA Saclay started using it in 2019

What they think of PyMoDAQ?
***************************

* *"The use of PyMoDAQ has really accelerated our experimental development by allowing to develop a modular acquisition
  system involving very different motorized stages or piezoactuators. It is now running everyday on our experiments,
  100% reliable"*, Dr Arnaud Arbouet, Senior Researcher CEMES/CNRS

* *Pymodaq is a python framework for data acquisition. If your specific device driver is not yet
  implemented, that is the only thing you will have to do. Pymodaq take care of the rest. Graphical
  user interface, synchronization of the instruments and so on, is already implemented. Once you have
  implemented your driver, you can release it for the community. That is how Pymodaq will get more and
  more complete. Of course you need to invest a bit of your time to get used to it, but it is worth it!*, Dr David
  Bresteau, Researcher at CEA Saclay, Attolab platform.

* We are setting up Pymodaq on our scanning NV microscopy and deep UV spectroscopy experiments and we appreciate a lot
  its easy installation, its modularity and the automatic generation of the graphical interfaces, as well as the strong
  community support. The updates of the modules, the training sessions organized regularly and the numerous video
  tutorials also reflect the vitality of the community. We also start contributing by adding our own instruments and
  functionalities to share them with all the users. We fully support this great project!
