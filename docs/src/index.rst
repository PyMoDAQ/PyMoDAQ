PyMoDAQ
=======

PyMoDAQ is a free and open-source software, officially supported by the CNRS, to efficiently setup the acquisition
program of your experiment with Python.
It simplifies the interaction with detector and
actuator hardware to go straight to the data acquisition of interest. It provides:

* a graphical interface
* the synchronization of the connected instruments
* data saving
* a modular architecture to easily integrate new instruments in your setup
... and many more features!

Overview
--------

PyMoDAQ is an advanced user interface to control and synchronize detectors and actuators.
Each of these have their independent interface called respectively :ref:`DAQ Viewer <DAQ_Viewer_module>` and
:ref:`DAQ Move <DAQ_Move_module>` *control modules*.

Detectors and actuators can be wrapped together in a :ref:`Dashboard_module` which implements a particular experimental
setup.
The Dashboard has functionalities to fully configure
all its detectors and actuators and
save their configurations in a :term:`preset` file that will, at startup, load and initialize all modules.

As soon as the Dashboard has been configured, all the :ref:`Dashboard Extensions <extensions>` can be used to perform
advanced and
automated tasks on the detectors and actuators.

* the :ref:`DAQ Scan <DAQ_Scan_module>` is the most common one. It allows to scan one or several actuators while
  acquiring and saving data from the detectors. A very large class or experiments can be performed with this extension.
* the :ref:`DAQ Logger <DAQ_Logger_module>` allows to log all the parameters of an experiment.
* the :ref:`PID extension <PID_module>` allows to lock a parameter of the experiment with a feedback loop on the
  actuators.

... to introduce a few of them!

   PyMoDAQ's Dashboard and its extensions: DAQ Scan for automated acquisitions, DAQ Logger for data logging and many
   other.

PyMoDAQ is maintained by a growing community of experimental physicists, and already implemented on many experiments.

By contributing to its development, you will learn the cutting edge tools of professional developers and start
experiencing how efficient it is
to code in a collaborative way!

Letâ€™s go for a :ref:`quick_start`!
