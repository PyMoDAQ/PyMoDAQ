Data Management
===============
Data are at the center of the PyMoDAQ ecosystem. From their acquisition up to
their saving and plotting, you'll be confronted with them. It is therefore of
paramount importance that data objects be well understood and be used
transparently by all of PyMoDAQ's modules.
