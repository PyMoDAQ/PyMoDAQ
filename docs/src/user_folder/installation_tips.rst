Tips/Issues for installation
============================


.. _linux_installation_section:


Linux installation
------------------
For Linux installation, only Ubuntu operating system are currently being tested. In particular, one needs to make sure
that the QT environment can be used. Running the following command should be sufficient to start with:

``sudo apt install libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xfixes0 x11-utils``

It is also necessary to give some reading and writing permission access to some specific folders. In particular,
PyMoDAQ creates two folders that are used to store configurations files, one assigned to the system in /etc/.pymodaq/
and one assigned to the user ~/.pymodaq/. We need to give reading/writing permission acess to the system folder.
One should then run before/after installing pymodaq:

* ``sudo mkdir /etc/.pymodaq/``
* ``sudo chmod uo+rw /etc/.pymodaq``

As a side note, these files are shared between different pymodaq's versions (going from 3 to 4 for example). It is
suggested to delete/remake the folder (or empty its content) when setting up a new environment with a different pymodaq
version.


.. _qt5backend:

Qt5 backend
-----------

PyMoDAQ source code uses a python package called `qtpy`__ that add an abstraction layer between PyMoDAQ's code
and the actual Qt5 python implementation (either PyQt5 or PySide2, and soon PyQt6 and PySide6). Qtpy will look on what
is installed on your environment and load PyQt5 by default (see the :ref:`configfile` to change this default behaviour).
This means you have to install one of these backends on your environment using either:

* ``pip install pyqt5``
* ``pip install pyside2`` (still some issues with some parts of pymodaq's code. If you want to help fix them, please, don't be shy!)
* ``pip install pyqt6`` (not tested yet)
* ``pip install pyside6`` (not tested yet)

.. _load_installed_tips:

Loading modules
---------------

Load installed scripts
++++++++++++++++++++++

During its installation, a few scripts have been installed within you environment directory, this means you can start
PyMoDAQ's main functionalities directly writing in your console either:

*  ``dashboard``
*  ``daq_scan``
*  ``daq_logger``
*  ``daq_viewer``
*  ``daq_move``
*  ``h5browser``
*  ``plugin_manager``


.. _run_module:

Execute a given python file
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you knwow where, within PyMoDAQ directories, is the python file you want to run you can enter for instance:

*  ``python -m pymodaq.dashboard``
*  ``python -m pymodaq.extensions.daq_scan``
*  ``python -m pymodaq.extensions.daq_logger``
*  ``python -m pymodaq.control_modules.daq_viewer``
*  ``python -m pymodaq.control_modules.daq_move``
*  ``python -m pymodaq.extensions.h5browser``
*  ``python -m pymodaq_plugin_manager.manager``

for PyMoDAQ's main modules. The *-m* option tells python to look within its *site-packages* folder (where you've just
installed pymodaq) In fact if one of PyMoDAQ's file (*xxx.py*) as an entry point (a ``if __name__='__main__:'``
statement at the end of the file), you can run it by calling python over it...


  .. _shortcut_section:

Creating shortcuts on **Windows**
---------------------------------

Python packages can easily be started from the command line (see :ref:`load_installed_tips`). However, Windows users
will probably prefer using shortcuts on the desktop. Here is how to do it (Thanks to Christophe Halgand for the
procedure):

* First create a shortcut (see :numref:`shortcut_create`) on your desktop (pointing to any file or program, it doesn't
  matter)
* Right click on it and open its properties (see :numref:`shortcut_prop`)
* On the *Start in* field ("DÃ©marrer dans" in french and in the figure), enter the path to the condabin folder of your
  miniconda or
  anaconda distribution, for instance: ``C:\Miniconda3\condabin``
* On the *Target* field, ("Cible" in french and in the figure), enter this string:
  ``C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k conda activate my_env & python -m pymodaq.dashboard``. This means that
  your shortcut will open the windows's command line, then execute your environment activation (*conda activate my_env*
  bit),
  then finally execute and start **Python**, opening the correct pymodaq file (here *dashboard.py*,
  starting the Dashboard module, *python -m pymodaq.dashboard* bit)
* You're done!
* Do it again for each PyMoDAQ's module you want (to get the correct python file and it's path, see :ref:`load_installed_tips`).
