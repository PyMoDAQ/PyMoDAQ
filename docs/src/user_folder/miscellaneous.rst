Plugin Manager
--------------

Any new hardware has to be included in PyMoDAQ within a :term:`plugin`. A PyMoDAQ's plugin is a python package
containing several added functionalities such as instruments objects. A instrument object is a class inheriting from
either
a ``DAQ_Move_base`` or a ``DAQ_Viewer_base`` class and implements mandatory methods for easy and quick inclusion
of the instrument within the PyMoDAQ control modules.

The complete list of available Instrument Plugins is maintained on this GitHub `repository`__.

While you can install them manually (for instance using ``pip install plugin_name``), from PyMoDAQ 2.2.2 a plugin
manager is available. You can open it from the **Dashboard** in the help section or directly using the command
line: ``python -m pymodaq_plugin_manager.manager`` or directly ``plugin_manager``

This will open the Plugin Manager User Interface as shown on figure :numref:`fig_plug_manager` listing the available
plugins packages that can be either *installed*, *updated* or *removed*. It includes a description of the content of
each package and the instruments it interfaces. For instance, on figure :numref:`fig_plug_manager`, the selected *Andor*
plugin package is selected and includes two plugins: a Viewer1D to interface Andor Shamrock spectrometers and a Viewer2D
to interface Andor CCD camera.

Linux installation
------------------
For Linux installation, only Ubuntu operating system are currently being tested. In particular, one needs to make sure
that the QT environment can be used. Running the following command should be sufficient to start with:

``sudo apt install libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xfixes0 x11-utils``

It is also necessary to give some reading and writing permission access to some specific folders. In particular,
PyMoDAQ creates two folders that are used to store configurations files, one assigned to the system in /etc/.pymodaq/
and one assigned to the user ~/.pymodaq/. We need to give reading/writing permission acess to the system folder.
One should then run before/after installing pymodaq:

* ``sudo mkdir /etc/.pymodaq/``
* ``sudo chmod uo+rw /etc/.pymodaq``

As a side note, these files are shared between different pymodaq's versions (going from 3 to 4 for example). It is
suggested to delete/remake the folder (or empty its content) when setting up a new environment with a different pymodaq
version.

Creating shortcuts on **Windows**
---------------------------------

Python packages can easily be started from the command line (see :ref:`section_how_to_start`). However, Windows users
will probably prefer using shortcuts on the desktop. Here is how to do it (Thanks to Christophe Halgand for the
procedure):

* First create a shortcut (see :numref:`shortcut_create`) on your desktop (pointing to any file or program, it doesn't
  matter)
* Right click on it and open its properties (see :numref:`shortcut_prop`)
* On the *Start in* field ("DÃ©marrer dans" in french and in the figure), enter the path to the condabin folder of your
  miniconda or
  anaconda distribution, for instance: ``C:\Miniconda3\condabin``
* On the *Target* field, ("Cible" in french and in the figure), enter this string:
  ``C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k conda activate my_env & python -m pymodaq.dashboard``. This means that
  your shortcut will open the windows's command line, then execute your environment activation (*conda activate my_env*
  bit),
  then finally execute and start **Python**, opening the correct pymodaq file (here *dashboard.py*,
  starting the Dashboard module, *python -m pymodaq.dashboard* bit)
* You're done!
* Do it again for each PyMoDAQ's module you want (to get the correct python file and it's path, see :ref:`run_module`).

What about the Hardware
-----------------------

So far, you've installed all the software layer managing Instrument control from the user
up to the manufacturer driver. This means you still have to install properly your specific hardware. For this, there
is no general recipe but below you'll find some advices/steps you can follow.

Serial/GPIB based hardware
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the case where your instrument is controlled using ASCII commands (basically strings), no more steps
than plugging you instrument is needed. Just make sur the COM port or GPIB address is correct.

Library based hardware
++++++++++++++++++++++

In the case of instruments using a specific manufacturer driver (*.dll*, *.so* or .NET libraries) then
you could follow these steps:

* Install the SDK/dll driver from the manufacturer
* Test the communication is fine using the software provided by the manufacturer (if available)
* Make sure your OS (Windows, Mac or linux) is able to find the installed library (if needed add the *path* pointing to
  your library in the **PATH** environment variable of your operating system
* Install the right PyMoDAQ's plugin
* You should be good to go!

.. warning::
    From Python 3.8 onwards, the way python looks for dlls on your system changed causing issues on existing plugins
    using them. So far the right way was to add the path pointing to your dll in the system PATH environment variable.
    This no longer works and ctypes ``LoadLibrary`` function raises an error. A simple solution to this issue, is to add
    in the preamble of my/your plugins this instruction:

    .. code::

        import os
        os.add_dll_directory(path_dll)

    where path_dll is the path pointing to your dll.

.. note::

  Example: if you want to use a NI-DAQ instrument. You'll have to first install their driver Ni-DAQmx, then test you
hardware
  using their MAX software and finally configure it using *pymodaq_plugins_daqmx* plugin.

Load installed scripts
----------------------

During its installation, a few scripts have been installed within you environment directory, this means you can start
PyMoDAQ's main functionalities directly writing in your console either:

*  ``dashboard``
*  ``daq_scan``
*  ``daq_logger``
*  ``daq_viewer``
*  ``daq_move``
*  ``h5browser``
*  ``plugin_manager``
